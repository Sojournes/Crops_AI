You have access to two primary data sources in an SQLite database:\n1.  'farmer_profiles': Contains information about farmer's land, preferences, and goals (use describe_table('farmer_profiles') to see exact columns).\n2.  'market_data': Contains market trends, pricing, demand, and sustainability metrics for various crops (use describe_table('market_data') to see exact columns).\n\nYour goal is to recommend optimal crops. To do this, you MUST first understand the farmer's specific situation and the available data.\n\nFollow these steps:\n1.  **Inspect Tables:** Use `list_tables()` and `describe_table()` for both 'farmer_profiles' and 'market_data' to understand their schemas (columns and data types). **Do this first.**\n2.  **Ask Clarifying Questions:** Based *only* on the columns present in the 'farmer_profiles' and 'market_data' tables, ask the user clear, specific questions to gather necessary information for filtering. For example, if 'farmer_profiles' has a 'region' column, ask \"What region is your farm located in?\". If 'market_data' has 'water_usage_index', and the farmer wants sustainable options, you might ask about water availability later. **Do NOT ask for information not present as columns in the database tables.** Start by asking essential filtering questions (like region, soil type, budget if available in the schema).\n3.  **Formulate Queries:** Once you have gathered sufficient information from the user, use `execute_query()` with SQL SELECT statements to filter the 'market_data' table. Your queries should join or filter based on the user's answers and the columns identified in step 1 (e.g., filter by region, soil compatibility, budget constraints, market demand, sustainability metrics like water usage or carbon footprint).\n4.  **Synthesize Recommendation:** Analyze the results from your SQL query. Present the top 1-3 crop choices to the user, explaining *why* they are suitable based on the data (e.g., \"Crop X is recommended because it matches your region, has high demand forecast, and aligns with your preference for low water usage.\").\n5.  **Tool Usage:** Only use the provided tools (`list_tables`, `describe_table`, `execute_query`). Only use `execute_query` for SELECT statements. Be precise with table and column names as discovered by `describe_table`.\n\nStart by inspecting the tables and then asking the user the most critical initial questions based on the table schemas.\n\"\"\"\n\nclient = genai.Client(api_key=GOOGLE_API_KEY)\n\n# Start a chat with automatic function calling enabled.\nchat = client.chats.create(\n    model=\"gemini-2.0-flash\",\n    config=types.GenerateContentConfig(\n        system_instruction=instruction,\n        tools=db_tools,\n    ),\n)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-20T14:56:57.284062Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-20T14:56:57.284354Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-20T14:56:57.692174Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-20T14:56:57.284327Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-20T14:56:57.691179Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Send an initial message to trigger the AI's process (inspecting tables)\ninitial_prompt = \"Please start by analyzing the available data tables.\"\nprint(f\"\\nUser: {initial_prompt}\")\n\ntry:\n    response = chat.send_message(initial_prompt)\n    print(f\"\\nAI Assistant: {response.text}\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n     print(f\"\\nError during initial chat interaction: {e}\")","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-04-20T14:56:57.693233Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-04-20T14:56:57.693538Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-04-20T14:56:59.989568Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-04-20T14:56:57.693517Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-04-20T14:56:59.988405Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# AI Conversation Simulation\n\nThis section simulates a conversation with the configured AI assistant.
